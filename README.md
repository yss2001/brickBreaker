## Guide
* There are 3 lives in total and must be used across 3 levels. Each level the progress is reset (that is, the brick layout is reset).
* The aim is to break all the non white bricks. The cyan, yellow and red bricks have strengths 1, 2, 3 respectively.
* Everytime the ball hits a brick, the strength is decreased by 1. The same applies for the paddle shooting bullets.
* When a brick's strength becomes 0, it disappears and powerups will fall down with some probability.
* The letters of the powerup indicate what they are: E refers to Expand, S refers to Shrink, F refers to Fastball, B refers to Shooting.
* Each powerup lasts for fifteen seconds, or 150 iterations. But Shooting lasts for 10 seconds, with a cooldown time of 10 frames - hence a max of 10 bullets can be shot.
* In last level, the UFO with a health of 25 is spawned. It sends down bombs after every 4 seconds.

* The paddle can be moved left using A and right using D.
* Levels can be skipped using S.
* When powered up by the shooting ability, pressing X sends bullets.
* Based on the distance from the centre of the paddle the ball hits, the x component of the ball's speed changes.
